# vuerealtimetable
This project shows how quick and easy is to display real time ticking data over the web, using modern technologies such as VueJS and Socket IO.

The project shows a web page and some dummy stock data with few stock symbols. The price are updated quite often. By leveraging the benefits of Vue JS and SockeIO the updates are possible with few lines of code while maintaining a reactive behavior.

The backend selected was Python Flask with websockets support.

TODOS:
1) Support of NodeJS and VueJs packages on the webserver
2) Server to subscribe to internal streaming data provider such as Apache Storm, ZMQ, AMPS or maybe other websites
3) Security support and authentication
